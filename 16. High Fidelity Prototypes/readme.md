This week’s assignment is for your team to produce a high-fidelity prototype that displays the content, visual design and the interaction elements of your technology. 

It should be a clickable prototype that allows us to click-through the screens to examine the content and interaction elements of your technology.

  1. Based upon your GROUP medium fidelity digital wireframes
  2. Create realistic design elements of how people will interact with your technology
        - include working interaction (link to different screens) 
        - create a ’clickable’ prototype
        - create a virtual identity or a brand image for the name of the product you have designed. 

Upload **a link** to your assignment using the file name convention:  <GROUPN0_Hi-Fi.pdf>

The PDF file you upload should include:  

1) COVER SHEET with the following:
(team name, team members, project title, problem statement)
2) TASK SEQUENCE the interface interaction is supporting (a list of the task sequence we should follow) (e.g. 1. click x, 2. fill in y)
3) A LINK to your clickable prototype
