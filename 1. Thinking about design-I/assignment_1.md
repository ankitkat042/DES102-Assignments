### TA's response:
> This was a good attempt.
However, you may want to think of somethings. The prompt was to choose a software/hardware/ object etc. You chose backlit keyboards. However your analysis seemed very centric to the backlighting feature. 'Feature' is just a part of the object that would contribute to the good design.
In this case, you may have wanted to expand your analysis beyond the backlight feature.
It is always great to not approach a thinking challenge with a bias in mind, this helps you explore a lot more!
