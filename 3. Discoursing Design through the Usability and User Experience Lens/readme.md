# 4. Creating an Interactive Product Using the Double Diamond of Design
> marked: 48/50
---
Imagine that you want to design a product that helps you organize a trip. This might be for a business or vacation trip, to visit relatives halfway around the world, or for a bike ride on the weekendâ€”whatever kind of trip you like. In addition to planning the route or booking tickets, the product may help to check visa requirements, arrange guided tours, investigate the facilities at a location, and so on.


1. Using the first three phases of the double diamond of design, produce an initial design using a sketch or two, showing its main functionality and its general look and feel. This activity omits the fourth phase, as you are not expected to deliver a working solution.
2. Now reflect on how your activities fell into these phases. What did you do first? What was your instinct to do first? Did you have any particular artefacts or experiences upon which to base your design?
