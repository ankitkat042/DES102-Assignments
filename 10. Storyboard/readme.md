> ## Create a storyboard - Develop a key sequence from your scenarios into a visual story

## Objectives 
Shaping a user journey.
On the person, the context, their needs, and their interaction with the technology. 
What do they get from the technology, what do they provide to the technology.

## 1.
    Describe the interaction context and interface type your system will support
    Briefly explain how integrating these into your design will help your target users achieve their goals

## 2.
    Design a detailed storyboard for your team's design idea. Select a key sequence from your scenarios and develop these further.

## Storyboard should contain:
    - scenes in sequential order
    - transitions between screens (how will the user move from one activity to the next)
    - clear indication of what each scene represents (what is the context)
    - a brief (1 or two lines) script that describes what users are saying, feeling or thinking in each storyboard box
