This weekâ€™s assignment is for your team to produce digital wireframes that display the content and interaction elements of your technology.

>Include a cover sheet with the following:
(team name, team members, project title, problem statement)


1. Create digital wireframes based upon the revised low-fi sketch GROUP UI prototype.

### Include:
    a) Each wireframe MUST be on a single page, ONE page per wireframe (do not put multiple small wireframes on a single page)
    b) After the cover sheet, include a page describing the scenario steps your wireframes are supporting 
        e.g. 
            1. Step one
            2. Step two
            3. etc
    c) Display concrete content related to your domain, not general or abstract placeholder text.
    d) Broad Breadth - represent all (or most) intended functionality. This is navigation LABELS, content AREAS
    e) Shallow Depth - specific TASK SEQUENCE actions that respond as though the user had provided real input. This is one scenario WORKFLOW that demonstrates how a user would complete a task to achieve their goals
    f) Homepage (LANDING page)
    g) ANNOTATE each wireframe to highlight the relevant features of each screen
    h) DEMONSTRATE how it provides a solution to your Problem Statement.

- Create UI screens informed by your Persona-Scenarios, Storyboards and Information Architecture
- Use the digital wireframe software of your choice


NOTE:
>Build upon previous work,  
ITERATE, do not start from a blank sheet of paper - all of your assignments are LINKED. The UX PROCESS is a PROGRESSION from assignment to assignment - building upon each deliverable.

NOTE FROM INSTRUCTOR:  
>There is no single rule for any of this. 
For text to be represented in Low Fidelity...  lines can be used. 
For text to be represented in Mid Fidelity... you can use Lorem Ipsum if you are not yet ready with the final text but have a good idea of what the content should be and the amount of text can be estimated. You can use actual or concrete text if you have finalized your text content. However, you don't need to identify the font style, size or weight just yet and use any default font.
