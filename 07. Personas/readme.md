## Objectives 
Begin thinking about who your users might be and how they would want to use the product, service, or system

1) Develop two or three personas for your project

2) Use the common persona structure of a photo, name, plus key goals, user quotes, behaviors, and some background information. 

3) Personas are based on real people, so choose friends or relatives that you know well to construct them.

4) Be specific and realistic, discuss a particular person in a particular place, engaged in a particular situation or action, for a particular reason
