### TA's response:
> A nice attempt.
Firstly, I believe you only focused on the number of buttons. That is fair, however you can think of many other aspects that can count as a bad design aspect to this object.
Then, you elaborated a lot on buttons and how they do not work. You can put these observations into points and elaborate separately on why they do not work. Remember, example is not a factual point, it should only strengthen your case. So, trying to lay down your points and their relevance more systematically.
