### Objectives
    Think about the organization of the system, how to categorize information and how users will interact with it.

For your next assignment each group will submit TWO deliverables.
(Create an an Information Architecture diagram for your prototype system.)  

### First  
    - Develop ONE diagram of your system - describe what content and tasks it will support (see the ‘broad and shallow’ example)

### Second,
    - Develop ONE workflow showing how a user will complete a primary task using your system from ‘A-to-B’ (see the ‘narrow and deep’ example)


NOTE,
- All boxes MUST be labeled to indicate what content would go into that section
